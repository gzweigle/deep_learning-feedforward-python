# deep_learning-feedforward-python
Deep Learning network in Python, Feedforward implementation.

Using as a simple (and fun) application, to get better at Python.

Written and tested with Python 3.6.

Presently expects MNIST data to be unzipped and located in a directory called mnist_data/ that is local to the Python code.

Algorithm details:
- RLU for hidden layers
- Sigmoid for output layer
- Cross entropy cost function
- Straightforward, textbook, implementation
- Configurable network depth and width
- Configurable minibatch size
- Configurable gradient descent step size

To do:
- Some form of regularization
- Variable size arrays design is too complex
